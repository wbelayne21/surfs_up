# surfs_up
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the investigation is to is to analyze the weather data of cities in Hawaii for an investor of our surf ‘n shake business (a surf and ice cream shop). We will use pandas and SQLAlchemy to query a SQLite data for average, minimum and maximums temperature of the months June and December. 
### Results:

-	We have a few more data points for the month of June than December
-	The average temperature of Oahu is 74.9 and 71.0 F in June and December with a standard deviation of 3.3 and 3.7 respectively.
-	In June the temperature of Oahu ranges from 64 to 85 F and from 56 to 83F in December. 
#### Summary: 
-	From the analysis we can deduce the maximum and minimum temperatures of Oahu. In general the max temperature of the area in winter and summer is around 83/85F. This merely tells us the temperature for two months.  
-	It would be beneficial to also query the precipitation and other weather conditions for the area such as wind speed, cloudiness, relative humidity etc… as they all affect the overall weather condition as well as tendency of people to go to the beach or get ice cream from a surf shop. 
-	Another recommendation would be to query the number of potential patrons of the shop. This can be done by analyzing the headcount of a beachgoers in the area during each month/season. 
-	Query the rest of the months in a year to grasp a better idea of what the temperature is like.
